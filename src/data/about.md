# Intro

I am a fullstack developer at [Progressive Insurance](https://progressive.com) where I am helping develop an accesible we app to automatethe fulfillment of customers accessibility requests.  Ienjoy being a full stack developer since I am still young in my career and it gives me the ability to try out the whole stack of development. In mt free time recently I have enjoyed studying Golang, algorithms, and self driving cars. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Progressive, I have learned how to build and support a reliable, scalable, and accessible web application with technologies like [.Net Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). I am currently a developer and post handoff will be the Technical App Owner and core supporter.

# Some history

- Most of my childhood was spent playing, fishing, and hunting outside with my siblings and cousins. Looking back I was somewhat illiterate when it came to computers outside of video games. This was only compounded when I would have a girl who sat next to me in the computer lab do my assignments for me out of confusion and frustration.

- My eighth grade year I decided I wanted to be an aerospace engineer after writing a report on the profession (and finding the pay quite attractive).

- My tenth grade year I entered my high school engineering program and took "Engineering Design and Development". I was fascinated by the amount of creativity CAD software offered and the ability to rapidly produce prototypes with our 3D printer.

- My 11th grade year I took the course "Digital Electrons" and enjoyed every second of it (particularly removing the resistors from circuits to blow up the lights). Here I gained the ability to do arithmetic in binary, boolean algebra, solder circuit boards, diagram circuits, and build circuits with breadboards.

- Planning to be a mechanical engineer, my final year of high school I took "Engineering Principles" and quickly fell out of love. It started off good learning about simple machines and mechanical advantage, but just seemed lackluster compared to digital electronics. Having to do truss calculations by hand did not help.

- After a not great time in engineering principles and subpar visits to the University of Akron I discovered the Bowling Green State was the cheapest school in Ohio and had a degree in Software Engineering which intrigued me.

- I began going home after school to follow youtube tutorials on how to build basic iPhone apps on my mom's iMac and loved the endless opportunities available when giving computers instructions.

- At university I learned all the typical topics: OOP, programming languages, computer architecture, OS, security, etc.

- I really fell in love with software development though when I interviewed for an internship early on they asked me about APIs and I had no idea what they were. I went back to my dorm endlessly read about them and realized that not only could I build my own but many companies offered what seemed like unlimited data for free to me via their APIs.

- Since I have particularly enjoyed using Spotify's and Youtube's.

- I am now a fullstack developer with imposter syndrome searching for the type of development I would like to do in the future. For now though I quite enjoy fullstack development.

# Fun facts

- There are an estimated .020317 in the world who have a similar set of physical and geographical characteristics as me. So give it 50 generations and you might meet someone kind of like me.
- I have a green belt in Judo I got during college.
- I think public libraries are under utilized.
- I eat about 2 pounds of meat a day.
- I am the only engineer I know to never take physics.

# I dream of

- Adding a dark mode to this site.
